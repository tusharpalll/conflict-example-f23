###Merge Conflicts

This is a repo that is used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention.

Merge conflicts are a common part of working with GitHub. Do not fear the conflicts, my friends! All will be well. W will solve the issues!

This is EXTRA more content that i added through github desktop. I am causing a merge conflict on purpose.
